The main will only call my hash3 function, which was my best, however, I have multiple other hash functions that
are not called.
Within in the main function and a couple of comments near the hash functions, I explain my process of 
improving my hash functions, and my other findings while going through the trial and error process.


I certify that the information contained in this README file is complete and accurate. I have both read and followed
the course policies in the 'Academic Integrity-Course Policy' section of the course syllabus.
